<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, this is one of the first projects that I've added to my portfolio. It's rather simple but still nice to have.</p>

<p>A little about me, I got my bachelors degree as a Software Engineer in September 2023. I'm planning on staying in the
  world of IT, but have no idea whether i'll be a developer or tester for example. I'd also like to start my own business,
  although it will take quite a while before that is possible.
</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies: I like to play sports. Sports like (kick)boxing, weightlifting, calisthenics. I also like to ride
  my motorcycle, it gives me a certain type of freedom. Socializing with friends is something I like to do as well, for
  example dinners, playing games, airsoft, escape rooms, that kind of stuff...
